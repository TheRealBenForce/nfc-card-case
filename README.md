# nfc-card-case
A modular 3D printable design for decorating nfc cards

When working through tuning the parameters to fit your specific needs, it is best to work top down. The code is designed to show the maxium amount of your artwork, to require low print material, and be very customizable. If your model disappears while adjusting parameters, you will need to lower the overhang in experimental.

This project's main focus for now is on nfc card cases, although that may evolve overtime. This program is flexible enough to print frames of any size that fits on a print bed, but not a lot of testing has been done here.
